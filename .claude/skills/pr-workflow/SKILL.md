# PR Workflow Skill

## Related Skills

- `github-issues` — PRs must reference an issue via `Closes #<number>`
- Branch naming rules: `.claude/rules/branch-naming.md`

## Before Creating a PR

1. **Verify branch naming** — must match `<author>/<type>/issue-<number>-<short-description>`
2. **Check diff size** — warn if over ~400 changed lines and suggest splitting
3. **Ensure commits reference the issue** — e.g., `Add validation (#12)`
4. **Push the branch** to remote if not already pushed

## Creating a PR

Use the PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`):

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "Short descriptive title" \
  --body "## Summary

Closes #<issue-number>

## Changes

## How to Test

1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Checklist

- [x] PR is under ~400 changed lines
- [x] Branch follows naming convention
- [x] Commits reference the issue number
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] At least one teammate has been requested for review" \
  --reviewer "teammate-username"
```

## Key Rules

- Always include `Closes #<number>` or `Fixes #<number>` in the PR body
- Target the `master` branch (or parent feature branch for sub-branches)
- Request at least one teammate as reviewer
- Use **merge commits only** — never squash or rebase
- Delete the branch after merging

## Collaborative Feature Branch Workflow

When multiple people are actively coding the **same feature** in parallel:

1. Feature owner creates a feature branch from `master`
2. Each contributor creates a sub-branch off the feature branch
3. Contributors open PRs targeting the feature branch (not master)
4. Feature owner reviews and merges contributor PRs
5. Each contributor is responsible for resolving conflicts in their own PR
6. When complete, feature owner PRs the feature branch into `master`

If only one person is implementing a feature, skip this — PR directly to `master`.

See [reference.md](reference.md) for the git commands.
